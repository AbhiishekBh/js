/* use let and const in your code and preffer not to use var because block scope and functional scope
okkk bro */
/* and also always use variable type like var , const ,let before declaring variable beacause in javascript  you can declare it without declaring 
varible type and will reserve the memory of that variable butttttttt this is bad practice   */
// in javascript you can use semicolon or not (;) it depend on you it will not generate errors.....
